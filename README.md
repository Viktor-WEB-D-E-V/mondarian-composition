# Mondrian Composition

This project is a CSS grid-based composition inspired by the abstract works of Piet Mondrian. It recreates the signature style of geometric shapes filled with primary colors and bold black lines.

## Features
- **CSS Grid Layout:** Uses a structured grid to arrange elements dynamically.
- **Primary Colors:** Incorporates red, blue, yellow, white, and black, resembling Mondrianâ€™s signature style.
- **Responsive Design:** Centers the composition within the viewport.
- **Minimalist Code:** Efficient use of CSS properties for a clean structure.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structuring the layout.
